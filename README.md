# Augmented Driver

The whole framework aims to simplify 3 aspects of writing JAVA E2E tests using WebDriver/Appium:
* Easy configuration for running tests and suites of tests in different browsers/devices, and simple out of the box integrations with SauceLabs and with CI systems, such as TeamCity
* Design so you are encourage to follow the [Page Object Model](https://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/PageObjects), and to encourage separation of concerns for modularizing your suite.
* A think layer on top of WebDriver/Appium with handy functionality that helps the development of tests, both in speed of development and also reliability of the tests.
